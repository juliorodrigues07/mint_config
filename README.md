# Mint Post-Installation
My personal scripts for running after installing Linux Mint, including the installation of packages, flatpaks, external software (.deb) and python libraries.
       
# Execution

- Default User:

      ./default_user.sh
      
- Root User:

      ./root.sh
      
- The default user script must be executed before the root script.
